# My Tech Journey
A portfolio app demonstrating my web development skills

I've been looking for new work opprtunities in the tech space, but my CV was a bit outdated.
Most opportunities I've found have required a portfolio, which isn't something I have. So I decided that I'll build a web app to demonstrate my skills and experience over the years to double as both a portfolio of work & an interactive CV.
This is the documentation of My Tech Journey to date
