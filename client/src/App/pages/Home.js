            My name is Howie Sommerfeld. I live in Johannesburg, South Africa and I love technology.

            I've recently been looking for new work opprtunities, but my CV was a bit outdated. <br/>
            Moreover, most of these opportunities require a portfolio of previous work.<br/>
            My professional portfolio is mostly proprietory, while a recent venture into the startup world has left me little time to dabble in the open source arena.
        </p>

            So I decided to build a web app that could demonstrate my skills, while highlighting my experience over the years. <br/>
            My thinking is that this could double as a sample of my coding work &  an interactive CV.
